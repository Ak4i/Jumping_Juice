    <p class="history">The story of Jumpin' Juice began in Seattle when Leonard Howl, <br>CEO and Founder, went on vacation to Hawaii, and along the way, tasted <br> some of their fresh and organic shakes. He was so amazed that he asked the <br>owners to teach him, and that's how Jumpin' Juices<br>journey began, now serving over 5,000 people.</p>
